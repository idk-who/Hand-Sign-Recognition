# Hand Sign Recognition with TensorFlow Object Detection and Python

This project demonstrates real-time sign language detection using TensorFlow Object Detection and Python. This project uses transfer learning to train the model with few labeled images. It utilizes the labelimg library to label hand sign gestures.

# Steps
1. Collect images for deep learning using your webcam and OpenCV
2. Label images for sign language detection using LabelImg
3. Setup Tensorflow Object Detection pipeline configuration
4. Use transfer learning to train a deep learning model
5. Detect sign language in real time using OpenCV
